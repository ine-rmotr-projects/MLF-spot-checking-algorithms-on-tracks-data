# Spot-checking algorithms on tracks data

Your task will be find the best algorithm to classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock'.

To do that you will apply a **Spot-checking** of different algorithms in order to discover which one might work the best.

We will use [The Echo Nest song dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/tasteprofile/), which contains tracks alongside the track metrics.
